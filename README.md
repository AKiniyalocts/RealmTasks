# RealmClear

To Do app built with Realm, inspired by [Clear for iOS](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear/).

**Warning:** This is very much a work in progress.
It's unclear how much further we'll even want to take this, if at all.

To run, execute `git submodule update --init --recursive`
then run the `RealmClear` scheme from Xcode. Xcode 7.3 is required.
